Version 0.06 "Giant Madagascar Day"
2010-12-10

- Debugger "list" command carries on where we last left off. By default
  it centers around the selected line. Use list> to force starting at the line.
- Reorganized command-processing code to simplify it, make it more dynamic,
  and allow for better expansion increasing DRYness. As a result
  some short abbreviations of commands have been dropped. Use "alias"
  to add back any that you want.
