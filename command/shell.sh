_Dbg_help_add shell \
"**shell** [*options*]

Options:
--------

   --no-fns  | -F  : don't copy in function definitions from parent shell
   --no-vars | -V  : don't copy in variable definitions
   --shell SHELL_NAME
   --posix         : corresponding shell option
   --login | l     : corresponding shell option
   --noprofile     : corresponding shell option
   --norc          : corresponding shell option

Enter a nested shell, not a subshell. Before entering the shell
current variable definitions and function definitions are stored in
profile $_Dbg_shell_temp_profile. which is is read in via the
**--init-file** option.

If you don't want variable definitions to be set, use option **-V** or
**--no-vars**. If you don't want function definitions to be set, use
option **-F** or **--no-fns**. There are several corresponding shell
options. Many of these by nature defeate reading on saved functions
and variables.

The shell that used is taken from the shell used to build the debugger
which is: $_Dbg_shell_name. Use **--shell** to use a different
compatible shell.

By default, variables set or changed in the shell do not persist after
the shell is left to to back to the debugger or debugged program.

However you can tag variables to persist by running the function
'save_vars' which takes a list of variable names. You can run this
as many times as you want with as many variable names as you want.

For example:
  save_vars PROFILE PARSER
marks variable PROFILE and PARSER to be examined and their values used
in the trap EXIT of the shell.
