_Dbg_help_add break \
'**break** [*loc-spec*]

Set a breakpoint at *loc-spec*.

If no location specification is given, use the current line.

Multiple breakpoints at one place are permitted, and useful if conditional.

See also:
---------

"tbreak" and "continue"'

_Dbg_help_add tbreak \
'**tbreak* [*loc-spec*]

Set a one-time breakpoint at *loc-spec*.

Like "break" except the breakpoint is only temporary,
so it will be deleted when hit.  Equivalent to "break" followed
by using "delete" on the breakpoint number.

If no location specification is given, use the current line.'
