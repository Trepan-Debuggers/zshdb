Set a Temporary Breakpoint (tbreak)
-----------------------------------

**tbreak** [ *location* ] [**if** *condition*]

With a line number argument, set a break there in the current file.
With a function name, set a break at first executable line of that
function.  Without argument, set a breakpoint at current location.  If
a second argument is `if`, subequent arguments given an expression
which must evaluate to true before the breakpoint is honored.

The location line number may be prefixed with a filename or module
name and a colon. Files is searched for using *sys.path*, and the `.py`
suffix may be omitted in the file name.
