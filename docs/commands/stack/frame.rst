Absolute Target Frame Positioning (`frame`)
-------------------------------------------

**frame**  [ *frame-number* ]

Change the current frame to frame *frame-number* if specified, or the
current frame, 0, if no frame number specified.

If a thread name or thread number is given, change the current frame
to a frame in that thread. Dot (.) can be used to indicate the name of
the current frame the debugger is stopped in.

A negative number indicates the position from the other or
least-recently-entered end.  So `frame -1` moves to the oldest frame,
and `frame 0` moves to the newest frame. Any variable or expression
that evaluates to a number can be used as a position, however due to
parsing limitations, the position expression has to be seen as a single
blank-delimited parameter. That is, the expression `(5*3)-1` is okay
while `(5 * 3) - 1)` isn't.

::

   frame     # Set current frame at the current stopping point
   frame 0   # Same as above
   frame 5-5 # Same as above. Note: no spaces allowed in expression 5-5
   frame 1   # Move to frame 1. Same as: frame 0; up
